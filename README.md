# Tabify

Tabify is a lightweight, efficient Obsidian plugin that lets you organize dense note content into clean, interactive tabbed containers. By utilizing a simple markdown code block syntax, you can seamlessly slice up long text, code snippets, or notes without cluttering your workspace visual layout.

## Features

* **Inline Tabbed Containers:** Group relevant content tightly together inside a single note view.
* **Intuitive Markdown Syntax:** Define tabs naturally using simple `=== Tab Title` block dividers.
* **Native Theme Integration:** Uses default Obsidian CSS variables so it looks beautiful instantly in both Light and Dark modes, regardless of your active community theme.
* **Ultra-Lightweight & Private:** Zero external tracking, zero bloat, and runs entirely locally.

## How to Use

Simply create a code block designated with the `tabs` language identifier. Define your tabs by prefixing each new section title with `=== `.

````text
```tabs
=== Tab One
This is standard text content running locally inside my first tab container.

=== Tab Two
This is text running completely independently inside tab two.

=== Tab Three
You can even add a third tab easily!
````

### How to preview:

1. Paste the block above into any note.
2. Switch your note to **Reading View** (or click away from the block in **Live Preview** mode) to watch your text transform into an interactive component.
